Hi professor, Asam and Chris here. So, we wanted to bring up an issue that we thought is worth bringing up in our projectâ€™s case. 

Long story short, while we were at the data-collection phase of the project, our sensor stopped working (we did go to you in class and got it confirmed that we needed a new sensor and that there were sadly no replacements), so we ordered a new sensor, and in the mean time, we got the data from someone else and decided to program the solution to the heart rate, systolic, and dystolic using C. 

At the end, we got the C program for heart rate, systolic, and dystolic to work perfectly fine; however, since the delivery of the sensor was delayed we ended up getting it on Sunday night, which was a day before the due date. And the next day, we decided to copy our C code over to VScode; however, the code was just throwing random outputs. We tried fixing it but we simply did not have enough time to successfully incorporate the heart rate, systolic, and dystolic code into our platformIO directory.

We hope that you can please be lenient and please take a look at our C-code since we took quite a while to come up with a solution for the values.
