# Embedded-Project
● Created a semi-automated blood pressure/heart rate measuring device with another team member
● Used pressure transducers to convert pressure data into digital data that an algorithm used to calculate three values: systolic,
diastolic, and heart beat values (referred to the oscillometric method)
● Used an Arduino alongside C programming (along with a cuff and a pressure sensor) to effectively create an at-home blood
pressure monitoring system.
