# Embedded-Project: At-Home Blood Pressure & Heart Rate Monitor

This project, a collaboration between myself and a team member, represents the development of a semi-automated blood pressure and heart rate monitoring device suitable for home use. The following key elements are noteworthy:

## Innovative Data Conversion

We integrated pressure transducers to transform pressure data into digital format. This digital data was subsequently processed by a sophisticated algorithm to calculate systolic and diastolic blood pressure values as well as heart rate metrics. This technique follows the principles of the oscillometric method, a reliable approach to blood pressure measurement.

## Hardware and Software Collaboration

The device was built using an Arduino microcontroller, programmed in C. Alongside this, we incorporated a cuff and a pressure sensor to capture the necessary physiological data.

## User-Centric Design

Our primary objective was to develop a user-friendly, effective at-home blood pressure monitoring system. The device's simplicity and ease-of-use make it a practical tool for regular monitoring and early detection of potential health issues.
The culmination of these elements is a semi-automated device capable of aiding individuals in tracking and managing their heart health from the comfort of their own homes. The technology behind this device could be a stepping stone towards more sophisticated and accessible health monitoring systems in the future.
